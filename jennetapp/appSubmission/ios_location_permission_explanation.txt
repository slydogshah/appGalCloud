Thanks for the feedback. Here is the information you requested

- Please clarify the use of background audio and location
Here is the detailed process: https://jen.appgallabs.io/how_it_works.html
Location is used to send a notification to the "closet" FoodRunner to the restaurant making a food pickup request.

- Please provide a demo video for the use of background audio that shows the functionality.
Please see the attached locationPermission.mov file

- Please also provide a demo account that shows an “active request”

Android Reference
I did a quick search for that and the only reference I see is in
flutter_icons:
  image_path: "icon/logo.png"
  android: true
  ios: true

If you could point me to any that you may have found, I will gladly rectify it.

Here is the modification that was made to the Info.plist file:

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<!--<string>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</string>-->
<string>#Jen Network collects location data to enable locating the closest FoodRunners even when the app is closed or not in use.</string>
