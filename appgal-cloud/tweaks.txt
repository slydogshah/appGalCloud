Push notification callback does not show requests

Food Pickup Pullout from history

Forgot Password: Add Cancel Button

Clear local data on logout

Register: Email and Password Required messages not showing

FoodRunner Login fails

App: When no requests or in-progress show a card instead of empty screen

Step 1: Schedule an Offline Dropoff
Step2: Finish all in progress
Step 3: Cannot go to Requests to Accept the Offline Dropoff (Bug)
Step 4: Accept Offline DropOff but In-progress screen did not reflect till App refresh (Bug)
Step5: Offline DropOff does not have an Org, So FoodRunner has to notify its dropped off so reflects in the PickupHistory (Bug)
