#Jen Network
The #Jen Network, is a Food Recovery Optimization Network.

It is an Uber-like Network for FoodRunners.

FoodRunners are volunteers with the #Jen Network IOS or Android App.

They volunteer to pick up surplus food from restaurants, startup cafetarias, parties, etc.

They then deliver it to a participating organization such as a Church, a Food Pantry, etc.

#Jen Network is designed to assist to help those that are hungry.
